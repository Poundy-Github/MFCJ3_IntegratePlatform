The SPI uses the service of the DMA for data transmission in asynchronous mode.
The Dma Channels used by Spi are configurable and the allocation of the same is
done in MCU. Each channel can work in software triggered mode or hardware
triggered mode. For SPI to use DMA channel, the channel should be configured as
hardware trigger type.

In this implementation the Combined Software/Hardware Controlled Mode will be
used. Hence the first DMA transfer will be triggered by software when setting
the corresponding request channel bit in the Software Transaction Request
Register, while the hardware requests are still disabled. The subsequent DMA
transfers are triggered by the corresponding hardware request, this happens
after the hardware requests have been enabled.

The QSPI Peripheralâ€™s RX or TX Interrupt Line is used to trigger the DMA
transactions. Each QSPI Peripheral uses two DMA channels to trigger reception
and transmission respectively.

The DMA Mechanism is used for the asynchronous transmission mode. It is not
used during synchronous transmission mode. The SPI handler driver initializes
the DMA channels used.

The DMA channel number used by SPI will be used as the priority number as per
HW recommendation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QSPI RX and TX have to be mapped to DMA - not to interrupts. Infineon IRQ
module is capable to map interrupt nodes to CPU0/CPU1/CPU2 interrupts or to DMA.
This functionality have to be implemented in the user application as part of
integration code with EB's Autocore OS or Safety OS and with AutoCore Generic.

Please copy following files
* "user application"\generate\templates\Spi_UserCode.h
* "user application"\generate\templates\Spi_UserCode.c
into your user application and add them to your build environment.

Please change following macros in Spi_UserCode.h to your needs
* #define QSPI_SCR_RX_PRIO  (4u)
* #define QSPI_SCR_TX_PRIO  (5u)
This example will map QSPI2RX to DMA channel 4 and QSPI2TX to DMA channel 5.

In order to map QSPI RX and TX the template function Spi_InitDMAUsr should be
executed after Spi_Init function. Therefore, please add include Spi_UserCode.h
in BswM_UserCallouts.c after include of Spi.h. Additionally add function call
Spi_InitDMAUsr after Spi_Init, e.g. SPI_INIT_FUNC function macro.
